# Connect N

Connect N is a basic connect 4 implementation with a twist.
After hearing someone recite there time in a coding interview having to implement increasingly difficult versions of connect 4 I got the inspiration to do it myself.

The goal:
- [x] Normal connect 4 on an NxM grid
- [x] Connect N
- [ ] An infinite play area
- [x] A 3D play area
- [ ] nD play area
- [ ] nD connect

# Running
I don't know why'd you want to run this, but if you do; runn the following

```bash
git clone https://github.com/platinumxy/connect-n.git
cd connect-n
python3 connectn
```
