# Connect N

Connect N is a basic connect 4 implementation with a twist.
After hearing someone recite there time in a coding interview having to implement increasingly difficult versions of connect 4 I got the inspiration to do it myself

The goal:
- [ ] Normal connect 4 on an NxM grid
- [ ] Connect N
- [ ] An infinite play area
- [ ] A 3D play area
- [ ] nD play area
